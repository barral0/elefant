# Getting Started

## 1. Create your first note

Click the **+** icon in the top-right of the sidebar. A new note called `Untitled.md` appears — click its name in the header to rename it.

## 2. Organise with folders

Click the **folder** icon in the sidebar to create a folder. Drag any note onto a folder to move it inside.

## 3. Format text

Use the **right-click menu** in the editor or keyboard shortcuts:

| Format | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| **Bold** | `Ctrl + B` |
| *Italic* | `Ctrl + I` |
| `Code` | `Ctrl + `` ` |

## 4. Insert images

Three ways to insert an image:

1. **Right-click → Insert Image** in the editor
2. **Ctrl+V** to paste an image from the clipboard
3. **Drag & drop** an image file onto the editor

A dialog lets you set display width and storage quality before inserting.

## 5. Change the theme

Open **⋮ menu → Theme Settings** to switch between dark and light mode, pick an accent colour, and adjust the editor font size.

## 6. Back up your notes

Notes live in **browser localStorage** — they are not synced or backed up automatically.

- `Ctrl + D` — download the current note as a `.md` file
- **⋮ menu → Download File** — same action

## 7. Import existing notes

**⋮ menu → Open File** — imports any `.md` or `.txt` file directly into the editor as a new note.
